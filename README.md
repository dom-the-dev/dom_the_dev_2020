Personal Portfolio of Dominik Amrugiewicz. My first published Project made with Gatsby.

If you want to use this code for your website, feel free to copy as many as you want. 

I appreciate if you link my page [domthedev.com](https://www.domthedev.com) back.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new my-default-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default
    ```


1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-default-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
